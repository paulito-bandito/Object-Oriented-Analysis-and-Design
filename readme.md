#  Object Oriented Analysis and Design Primer # 
Paul Walter, Janurary 2nd 2014

The following project contains two case studies to introduce students to the "Object Oriented Analysis and Design" (OOAD) design process; promoting the idea of design before implementation. 

It walks them through the process of:
1) Identifying the problem domain in plain (non-technical) language
2) Analysing that language using a Genus-Differentia Format into discrete elements
3) and then forward engineering those elements into a design using UML. 

Be sure to open up the "UML cheat-sheet" that outlines the UML elements and how they are forward engineered into code (Java).

This was for Programming I: start your students early on design!

-------------------------------------------
		1.) "Fallout Message System" Exercise + Case-Study
-------------------------------------------

This was a step by step case study, where I outlined what was needed to discover the requirements and design elements in their software solution. 

There are three main parts to this case study:

1) OOAD_CaseStudy_FalloutMsgSys.docx
2) OOAD_CaseStudy_FalloutMsgSys_Diagrams.pptx
3) OOAD_CaseStudy_FalloutMsgSys_SourceCode.zip

The "OOAD_CaseStudy_FalloutMsgSys.docx" outlines all the necessary steps for requirement discovery. 

The "OOAD_CaseStudy_FalloutMsgSys_Diagrams.pptx" was a student submission (that followed the .docx) that I am using with their permission (Crystal Hall). It illustrates an excellent first attept at designing before implementation. 

The "OOAD_CaseStudy_FalloutMsgSys_SourceCode.zip" is the resulting source code.

		2.) "Flea Circus" Exercise + Case-Study
-------------------------------------------

The "Flea Circus" is an implementation of a Class Diagram so the students could go back and forth and see how the Class Diagram related to the Code Implementation. 

There are a couple of parts to be aware of:

1) The .gif Class Diagram (FleaCircusClassDiagram.gif)
2) The forward-engineered code that the Class Diagram Represents.
3) The Javadocs in the "documentation" folder. Start with the index.html file.  
4) The class diagram (.uxf) was created with Umlet. It can be found here: http://www.umlet.com/changes.htm
